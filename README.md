## Installation
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```sh
   chmod +x quickfix.sh
   ```
3. (Optional) Move it to a directory in your PATH, e.g. `/usr/local/bin`.

## Optional: Double-Click Usability
To run the tool by double-clicking in Finder:
1. Duplicate `quickfix.sh` and rename it to `quickfix.command`.
2. Ensure it starts with `#!/bin/bash` and is executable:
   ```sh
   chmod +x quickfix.command
   ```
3. Double-click `quickfix.command` in Finder to launch in Terminal.

## Troubleshooting
- **Permission Denied:**
  - Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x quickfix.sh`
  - Some actions require `sudo` and will prompt for your password.
- **Operation Not Permitted (cache clearing):**
  - Some system/user cache files are protected by macOS and cannot be deleted, even with `sudo`. These are safely ignored.
- **Missing tools:**
  - Some features require tools like `dig`, `traceroute`, or `mas`. Install them via Homebrew if missing.
